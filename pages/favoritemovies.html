    <h1>Jordan Is Lame</h1>
    <h2>Favorite Movies</h2>
    
    I grew up a denizen of the 4chan hobby boards, and I think my taste reflects that. There's a lot of hipster shit.

    <p>I really admired Kubrick and art films in general in my late teens to mid twenties. And I still do. But they added dimension to my life at the time. I wanted to make some crazy Lynchian films and especially something like Tetsuo: The Iron Man. Shinya Tsukamoto was one of my biggest influences because of his industrial style and I wanted to create something with that raw concrete-and-metal feeling like Akira or Eraserhead. Black and white independent films like Pi or The Following were inspiring to me for the idea of the indie auteur with the 16mm Bolex camera. So this film idea of mine was supposed to be black and white and industrial and a fair bit like Tetsuo. But it's expensive to produce films and difficult to get permits or people to cooperate so I haven't shot any dramatic films since high school.</p>
    <p>I love the aesthetics of dark films such as Midsommar, Perfect Blue, or The Thing. Dark moods involve more emotional complexity and are more interesting to me than blockbuster films. And I was a fan of experimental avant-garde music from a young age, as something prompted me to find the weirdest music possible when I was like 13. I like when music gets dissonant and shrill and the mood is warped.</p>
    <p>Some of my favorite directors are Lynch, Godard, Kubrick, Tarantino, Tsukamoto, Edgar Wright, and Wong Kar Wai.</p>
    <p>I'm not that into TV, but liked Breaking Bad, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Always Sunny, and Rick & Morty.</p>
