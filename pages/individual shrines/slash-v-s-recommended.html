                    <p><strong>/v/'s Recommended Games Wiki</strong></p>
                    <p>In my early teens I spent a lot of time just reading Wikipedia articles of music and video games. I would go through the Wikipedia articles of music genres or game consoles and just look up every release. At one point, I looked up every game for the Sega Dreamcast, for example.</p>
                    
                    <p>What this means is that I was trying to wade through the shovelware trash and learn about the games before buying them. I had bought garbage games many times before, and didn't want to be stung again. I also was listening to video game music from the Sega Genesis at that age, so just looking up the soundtracks of all the console's games was one way to find the best soundtracks.</p>
                    
                    <p>The natural conclusion of this, with me also being a 4chan user, was to start using <b>/v/'s Recommended Games</b> wiki. I had played a lot of the cult-favorite games like <em>Zack &amp; Wiki</em> and <em>Okami</em> already, but still had more to check out like <em>Muramasa</em>, <em>Sin &amp; Punishment 2</em>, or <em>de Blob</em>.
                    
                    <p>I've put hundreds of hours into reading these wikis and watching YouTube game reviews and longplays. At one point I probably had an encyclopedic knowledge of games from the Atari 2600 to the Wii. I read the wikis for the Saturn, the 3DS, the Gamecube, the Neo Geo, the PS1, the PS3, the NES, the N64, etc., and watched a shit-ton of retro game videos, along with reading magazines like <em>Nintendo Power</em> and <em>EGM</em>, websites like <em>Hardcore Gaming 101</em> and <em>1-Up</em>, and the list goes on. I pretty much would have become <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/scottthewoz">Scott the Woz</a> if I had the money to buy a massive gaming collection and the video production gear.</p>
                    
                    <p>Anyways, here's what <a href="https://vsrecommendedgames.fandom.com/wiki/Wii">/v/'s Recommended Games Wiki</a> looks/looked like. It used to be hosted on Wikia, now it's on Fandom.</p>

Beautiful visuals, sound and design in every aspect, nothing about this game will disappoint. The game feels like a perfect blend of old and new school. No Wii IR shit, just plug in dat Nunchuck and get playin', because this will fully envelope you in its child-like atmosphere and give you a warm feeling of nostalgia. The few drawbacks include a few strange choices in the control scheme, and signs fucking everywhere. Features a hug button which makes the boy hug the blob and the player 'aww'. Re-released on Xbox One, PS4 and PC.</td>

However, character customization is shockingly in-depth, and latter parts of the game present quite a challenge. If you're looking for a JRPG that won't hold your hand, and can look past its issues, this is a solid Wii purchase, especially considering it doesn't have a lot of competition on the console.</td>

As you can imagine, this can become chaotic fast, especially when playing with four players. The game's saving grace is that it has an incredible editor where you can create and customize anything from bullets and ships to entire levels and bosses so you can remove or improve the game's attachment mechanic. There was also the ability to download and upload your creations online, but that has been discontinued.</td>
